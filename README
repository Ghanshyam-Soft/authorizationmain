The main application for Authorization.

Please see the README in the Payments Parent repo for more information.

When running the jar, it is necessary to provide the profile, as below. For the valid profiles see the names of the properties files. example:
	java -jar -Dspring.profiles.active=dev authorization-main.jar
	
In order to develop for this project, you must install Lombok to your IDE. Simply download it, run the installer, and select your IDE.

Note there are currently two different @Value annotations used in this project (never in the same class).
	org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Value - Spring's property injection annotation
	lombok.Value - the version of Lombok's @Data annotation for immutable classes

The local swagger endpoint is <host>:<port>/swagger-ui/index.html. For example:
	http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html

For example requests, see the Swagger ui or the postman collection.

All requests require OAuth (except Swagger which requires basic auth), Nicholas can provide you the credentials for dev. 
Do note that the child guid must be unique for each request. I suggest just adding/deleting random numbers and letters to achieve that for dev purposes.

When running on your local machine, it is not possible to access the keyvault. Thus we need to provide the following vm arguments.
The values for the arguments can be found in the non-prod keyvault under the same name (minus of course "-D"). Those secrets can not be committed to the repo.
	-Dpay09.app.dev.password=
	-Dstpay.service.auth.key=
	-Dstpay.service.auth.secret=
	-Dcard-consent-service-username=
	-Dcard-consent-service-password=
	
Note, in order for MIT to work from your local, you must add the Staples Root cert into the keystore for the java version used by your IDE.
